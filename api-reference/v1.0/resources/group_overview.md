# Working with groups in Microsoft Graph

Groups are collections of [users](user.md) and other principals who share access to resources in Microsoft services or in your app. Microsoft Graph provides APIs that you can use to create and manage different types of groups and group-related functionality. All  operations on groups in Microsoft Graph require administrator consent.

> **Note**: You must use a work or school account to create groups. Groups are not supported for personal Microsoft accounts.

## Types of groups

The following table lists the types of groups that you can access via Microsoft Graph APIs.

| Type              | Used to | groupType | Mail-enabled | Security-enabled | Can be created via APIs? |
|-------------------|----------|-----------|--------------|------------------|--------------------------------|
| Office 365 groups | Facilitate user collaboration with shared Microsoft online resources. | ["Unified"] | True | False | Yes | [user](user.md) | 
| Security groups | Control user access to in-app resources. | [] | False | True | Yes |
| Mail-enabled security groups | Control user access to in-app resources, with a shared group mailbox. | [] | True | True | No |
| Distribution groups | Distribute mail to the members of the group. We recommend that you use Office 365 groups instead of distribution groups because they provide a richer set of resources. | [] | True | False | Yes |

### Office 365 groups in Outlook
Office 365 groups enable powerful collaboration, and are designed for people who work together on a project or a team. Office 365 groups include resources that members of the group share, including:

- Outlook conversations
- Outlook calendar
- SharePoint files
- OneNote notebook
- SharePoint team site
- Planner
- Intune device management

Other resources that apply to Office 365 groups but can't be accessed via APIs include: 

- Dynamics CRM
- Microsoft Social Engagement
- Microsoft Stream
- Microsoft StaffHub

The following is an example of an Office 365 group in Outlook.

```http

{
    "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#groups/$entity",
    "id": "4c5ee71b-e6a5-4343-9e2c-4244bc7e0938",
    "deletedDateTime": null,
    "classification": "MBI",
    "createdDateTime": "2016-08-23T14:46:56Z",
    "description": "This is an Outlook group",
    "displayName": "OutlookGroup101",
    "groupTypes": [
        "Unified"
    ],
    "mail": "outlookgroup101@service.microsoft.com",
    "mailEnabled": true,
    "mailNickname": "outlookgroup101",
    "preferredLanguage": null,
    "proxyAddresses": [
        "smtp:outlookgroup101@microsoft.onmicrosoft.com",
        "SMTP:outlookgroup101@service.microsoft.com"
    ],
    "securityEnabled": false,
    "theme": null,
    "visibility": "Public"
}
```

### Security groups and mail-enabled security groups
Security groups are used to control user access to resources. Your app can use security group memberships to make authorization decisions when users try to access secure resources within the app. Security groups can have users and other security groups as members.

Mail-enabled security groups are similar to security groups, with the added feature of a shared mailbox. Mail-enabled security groups can't be created through the API, but other group operations work on them. For more details, see [Manage mail-enabled security groups in Exchange](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb123521(v=exchg.160).aspx).

The following is an example of a security group.

```http
{
    "@odata.type": "#microsoft.graph.group",
    "id": "f87faa71-57a8-4c14-91f0-517f54645106",
    "deletedDateTime": null,
    "classification": null,
    "createdDateTime": "2016-07-20T09:21:23Z",
    "description": "This group is a Security Group",
    "displayName": "SecurityGroup101",
    "groupTypes": [],
    "mail": null,
    "mailEnabled": false,
    "mailNickname": "mysg",
    "preferredLanguage": null,
    "proxyAddresses": [],
    "securityEnabled": true
}
```
### Other types of groups

Office 365 groups in Yammer are used to facilitate user collaboration through Yammer posts. This type of group can be returned through a read request, but their posts can't be accessed through the API. To learn more, see [Yammer developer API docs](https://developer.yammer.com/docs).

## Dynamic membership 
All types of groups can have dynamic membership rules, which automatically add or remove members from the group based on user properties. For example, a "Marketing employees" group would include every user with the department property set to "Marketing", so that new marketing employees are automatically added and employees who leave the department are automatically removed from the group. This rule can be specified in a "membershipRule" field during group creation as ```"membershipRule": 'user.department -eq "Marketing"'``` GroupType must also include ```"DynamicMembership"```. The following request creates a new Office 365 group for marketing employees. 

```http
POST https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups
{
    "description": "Marketing department folks",
    "displayName": "Marketing department",
    "groupTypes": [
        "Unified",
        "DynamicMembership"
    ],
    "mailEnabled": true,
    "mailNickname": "marketing",
    "securityEnabled": false,
    "membershipRule": 'user.department -eq "Marketing"',
    "membershipRuleProcessingState": "on"
}
```

For more information, see [Create attribute-based rules for dynamic group membership in Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/active-directory-groups-dynamic-membership-azure-portal).

> **Note**: Dynamic membership rules require the tenant to have a license at tier [Azure Active Directory Premium P1](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/active-directory/) or greater.
